Title: Label-Free Identification of Endogenous Informative Single Cell Mitochondrial RNA Mutation for Lineage Analysis and Clonal Evolution
Version: 0.99.1
Author: Jia Song

Description: The whole genome RNA SNP is used as endogenous markers for lineage study.
    This package identifies clonal features based on single cell RNA sequencing data solely by integrating mutation type and subspace-subspace cross entropy into consideration.
